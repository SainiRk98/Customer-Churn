Customer-Churn-Analysis

Project Objective:-
Customer churn prediction is a crucial aspect of business intelligence that helps companies retain customers by identifying those likely to leave. 
This repository provides a machine learning-based solution for predicting customer churn using various techniques, including data preprocessing, 
feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Project Description:-
Key Factors Influencing Churn: Analysis revealed that factors such as contract type, monthly charges, and customer tenure significantly impact churn rates.
Feature Importance: Random Forest and XGBoost models highlighted that contract type and tenure are among the most important predictors.
Customer Segmentation: Cluster analysis helped identify customer groups more likely to churn, enabling targeted retention strategies.

Business Insights:-
Retention Strategies: Offering discounts or incentives to customers with short tenure or high monthly charges may help reduce churn.
Service Improvement: Addressing customer complaints promptly and improving service quality in identified risk areas can enhance customer satisfaction.
Automated Alerts: Deploying an alert system to flag high-risk customers in real-time can aid in proactive engagement.
